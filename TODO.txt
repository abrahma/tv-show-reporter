*** constructor of AddShowModal is called multiple times

1) Should we have explicit data model and parse the response accordingly
2) how to handle data updation in nested UI component
e.g. State is in App.js, Modification has to be done in ShowDetails and the state needs to be updated
3) Is there a way to extract horizontal list as a component and pass respective card as prop
4) In CastInfoCard.js, is there an ES6 way to avoid bind
5) If I change the CSS lib or a new lib say bootstrap/font-awesome, rest of the styles using em/rem is impacted. How to handle this
